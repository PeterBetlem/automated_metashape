# Image processing scripts using Python

This repo contains various Python scripts that are used for image processing, in particular those useful for photogrammetry.
As a result, the scripts are designed with the standardised Agisoft Metashape Python workflow in mind, utilising a fully compatible YML configuration file

## Requirements & setup
**Python**: You need Python (3.5, 3.6, 3.7), and I recommend using the Anaconda distribution and a processing-specific Anaconda environment.
At the bare minimum the following libraries should be installed besides the standard libs:
- numpy
- pandas
- opencv2

**How to use**: Simply clone this repository to your machine!

## Usage
Please follow the tutorial and extended manual found at:
